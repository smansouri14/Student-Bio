    I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. After highschool I attended the University of Arizona where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Public Health,
    with a minor in Business in 2014. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I am an active member in the community participating as a health education intern with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love to travel all over the world. Places I have been include Ireland, England, Iran, Hawaii, Portland, Seattle, Toronto, and many more. I also enjoy cooking food for my  wife and I. I even brew my own cold brew coffee. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Additionally, I love sports and I am a huge Arsenal football fan (aka soccer). I try and not miss a game even if this means waking up at 4:00 AM to watch.
